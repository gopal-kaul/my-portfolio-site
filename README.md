This is my portfolio site, which I will host soon.
To clone this repo, install django, clone the repo, cd into repo and run python3 manage.py runserver
to run it locally
Can be done as so:
```
git clone https://github.com/gopal-kaul/MyBlog.git
cd my-portfolio-site
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
